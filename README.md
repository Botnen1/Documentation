# Documentation
Documentation is written information that describes and explains a product, system, or service. It can take many different forms, such as user manuals, technical guides, and online help resources.

This first version is capable of scanning all python files in the directory and extract all functions and variables  'per file'  and store the complete documentation in a file called generated_documentation.txt

Just add the auto_doc.py into the directory you have your python files and run it in your terminal > python auto_doc.py


The future:

Future iterations of the program will have to include comments and docstrings
Maybe the program should also be able to document other types of code than just python
